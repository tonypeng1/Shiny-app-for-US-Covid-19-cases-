Raw data of accumulated total cases (based on counties) is uploaded from USAFACTS Covid-19 site each time the app is run. 
Data from the major county that covers a city is used to approximate the statistics of that city. For large metro city region data from several counties may be used. R code is used to calculate daily new cases from the accumulated total cases.
